onboardingPage1Headline;Introduction
onboardingPage1Label1;Shogi (将棋) is a two-player strategy board game native to Japan, belonging to the same family as chess and xiangqi.
onboardingPage1Label2;Shogi proverbs are technical tips for the player to lead them in the right direction when they are unsure of what move to play.
onboardingPage1Label3;This app contains 50 such proverbs for beginner to intermediate players. These proverbs are taken from Takako Tombo Noda's website, which in turn contains translations of Masahiko Urano's book Shogi Kakugen Mame Jiten (Tiny dictionary of Shogi proverbs).
onboardingPage1Label4;Although this website is still online, it is not optimized for mobile and the diagrams can be difficult to dephicer. Thus the goal of this mobile application is to make this excellent content more accessible to beginners in 2020.
onboardingPage1Label5;It is assumed that neither Mr. Noda nor Mr. Urano would have anything against this open source project. No copyright infringement is intended.
