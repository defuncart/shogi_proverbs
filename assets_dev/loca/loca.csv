onboardingPage1Headline;Introduction
onboardingPage1Label1;Shogi (将棋) is a two-player strategy board game native to Japan, belonging to the same family as chess and xiangqi.
onboardingPage1Label2;Shogi proverbs are technical tips for the player to lead them in the right direction when they are unsure of what move to play. This app contains 50 such proverbs for beginner to intermediate players.
onboardingPage1Label3;These proverbs are taken from Takako Tombo Noda's website, which in turn contains translations of Masahiko Urano's book Shogi Kakugen Mame Jiten (Tiny dictionary of Shogi proverbs). Although this website is still online, it is not optimized for mobile, while the diagrams can be difficult to decipher.
onboardingPage1Label4;The goal of this open source project is to make this excellent content more accessible to beginners in the mobile age, and it is assumed that neither Mr. Noda nor Mr. Urano would not support this goal. No copyright infringement is intended.

shogiNotationPage1Label1;The shogi board contains 9 x 9 squares, which are labeled horizontally leftwards by 1 - 9 and vertically downwards by a - i.
shogiNotationPage1Label2;Thus square 1a is the upper leftmost square, while 9i is the bottom rightmost square.
shogiNotationPage2Headline;Shogi pieces
shogiNotationPage2Label1;Although Black and White's pieces are displayed on the board with upper case (K) and lower case (k) letters respectively, this has no bearing on the move notation which is always capitalized.
shogiNotationPage2Label2;The following pieces are often refered to by their Japanese names:

shogiNotationPage3Label2;Player is denoted by ☗ for black and ☖ for white.
shogiNotationPage3Label3;Movement is denoted by -, x and * for simple movement, capture and drop, respectively.
shogiNotationPage3Label4;If a move entitles the player to promote their piece, then promotion is denoted by +, while declined promotion is denoted by =.
