# Shogi Proverbs

A mobile application containing various Shogi proverbs.

## About

Shogi (将棋) is a two-player strategy board game native to Japan, belonging to the same family as chess and xiangqi. Shogi proverbs are technical tips for the player to lead them in the right direction when they are unsure of what move to play.

All content is taken from Takako Tombo Noda's website, which in turn contains translations of Masahiko Urano's book *Shogi Kakugen Mame Jiten (Tiny dictionary of Shogi proverbs)*.

As Mr. Urano gave permission to Mr. Noda to publish the content online to help beginner players around it world, it is assumed that neither Mr. Noda nor Mr. Urano would have anything against this open source app whose goal is to similarly help shogi players using mobile applications.
