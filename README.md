# Shogi Proverbs

Shogi (将棋) is a two-player strategy board game native to Japan, belonging to the same family as chess and xiangqi. Shogi proverbs are technical tips for the player to lead them in the right direction when they are unsure of what move to play. This app contains 50 such proverbs for beginner to intermediate players. 

## Content

These proverbs are taken from Takako Tombo Noda's [website](http://www.shogi.net/kakugen/), which in turn contains translations of Masahiko Urano's book *Shogi Kakugen Mame Jiten (Tiny dictionary of Shogi proverbs)*. Although this website is still online, it is not optimized for mobile, while the diagrams can be difficult to decipher. 

The goal of this open source project is to make this excellent content more accessible to beginners in the mobile age. As Mr. Urano gave permission to Mr. Noda to publish his content online to help beginner players around the world, it is assumed that neither Mr. Noda nor Mr. Urano would similarly not support this project's goal. No copyright infringement is intended.
